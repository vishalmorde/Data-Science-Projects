This project involves using LDA (Latent Dirichilet Allocation) algorithm to uncover hidden topics from customer complaints data. The complaints data was obtained from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau website (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/) with a focus on credit card products.

Results: The model was used to categorize customer complaints into more accurate and intuitive categories, reducing rerouting of complaints and improving overall customer experience. This work led to several Customer Insights initiatives at Barclays leading to 4-year-low complaint rate and allowed us to move from 7th and 3rd position in 2018 J. D. Powers Customer Satisfaction rankings for Financial Services.

Python Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, SpaCy, Gensim, Mallet, pyLDAvis
