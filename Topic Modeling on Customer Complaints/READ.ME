Topic Modeling on Customer Complaints using LDA Algorithm

Summary: This project involves using LDA (Latent Dirichilet Allocation) algorithms to uncover hidden topics from customer complaints data. The complaints data was obtained from Consumer Finance Protection Bureau website (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/) with a focus on credit card products.

Results: The model was used to categorize customer complaints into more accurate and intuitive categories, reducing rerouting of complaints and uncovering hiddent themes in the data.

Python Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, SpaCy, Gensim, Mallet, pyLDAvis
