Obejective: To build a predictive model for detecting credit card fraud using supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.

Data: Public dataset from Kaggle Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It has 284K samples and 30 independent variables.

Algorithms: Supervised ML - Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchniques) for handling class imbalance Deep Learning-based Methods - AutoEncoders Unsupervised ML - Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forest

Results: Unsupervised methods, especially Isolation Forest provides a more robust and stable method for ever-evolving transactions and application credit card fraud
